Workflow Steps

EC2 Instance (Private Subnet) uploads or deletes objects in the S3 bucket using the VPC Endpoint, without internet access.

S3 Bucket is configured with event notifications to trigger a Lambda function on object creation or deletion.

The Lambda function captures event details (file name, bucket, action type, etc.).

Lambda publishes this event information to an Amazon SNS topic.

SNS sends an email notification to the subscribed user with the event details.

All communication happens securely inside the VPC, ensuring no data exposure to the public internet.

IAM roles and policies are applied following the principle of least privilege.

The entire workflow is serverless, automated, and cost-optimized.

🧰 Technologies Used

Amazon EC2 – Used as a private compute instance to upload/delete files securely.

Amazon S3 – Stores objects and triggers Lambda on file changes.

AWS Lambda – Processes S3 events and invokes SNS notifications.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) – Sends real-time email alerts.

VPC Endpoint for S3 – Enables secure, private connectivity between EC2 and S3 without internet exposure.

IAM Roles & Policies – Provide fine-grained, least-privilege access control.

AWS CloudWatch Logs – Monitors Lambda executions and event activity.

🌟 Key Features

✅ Fully Secure Architecture: All communication stays within a private VPC, with no public internet access.

⚡ Event-Driven Automation: Lambda automatically triggers upon any file upload or deletion in S3.

📧 Instant Notifications: Real-time email alerts for every S3 event via Amazon SNS.

🧱 Modular & Scalable: Can easily extend to multiple buckets, users, or notification types.

🧩 Serverless and Cost-Efficient: Uses pay-per-use AWS services, eliminating infrastructure overhead.

🔐 Best Security Practices: IAM least-privilege roles, no hardcoded credentials, and private data flow.
